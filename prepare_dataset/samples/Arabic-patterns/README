Arabic Morphological Patterns/Templates by Mohammed Attia

This is the Arabic Morphological Patterns/Templates manually created by Mohammed Attia.
It contain 491 morphological patterns.
In the derivational morphology Arabic words are formed through the amalgamation of two tiers, 
namely, root and template. A root is a sequence of three consonants, and the template is 
a pattern of vowels, or vowels with consonants, with slots into which the consonants of 
the root are inserted. This process of insertion is called interdigitation
